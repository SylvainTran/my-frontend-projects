    <p>Thanks to early access testers. Things I'm aware of: Inexistent, destitute game art, lazy camera when too far, lack of website responsiveness for mobile and other devices.</p><br>
    <h5>Manual Instructions</h5>
    <ul style="text-align: start; margin-left: 50px; font-size: 0.4em;">
        <li>Controls: Left click on terrain to move there.</li>
        <li>Camera: Mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Hold left click and pan to rotate (this can zoom in the camera). Hold both buttons to do both at the same time. (MAJOR UPDATE TO 'CAMERA FOLLOW' UPCOMING)</li>
        <li>Character: Left click on a resource (i.e., a tree) to open the action context menu.</li>
        <li>Character: Left click on a resource in inventory (i.e, wood) to open the inventory context menu. Only 'Trade to Broker' is implemented so far.</li>
        <li>Character: Left click on a resource in brokerage (i.e, wood) to open the brokerage context menu. Click on a seller's ID to buy their stuff.</li>
        <li>Economy: An item's valuation will fluctuate depending on economics laws and free market fluctuations, based on supply and demand. (Not implemented yet)</li>
        <li>Events: Special resources like trees (and other stuff like chickens and peanuts) spawn at a fixed interval depending on what resources are left. Access to these resources will be determined by luck and a player's proximity to the spawn point. (Not implemented yet)</li>
        <li>Goals: Find lost crabs and souls (Not implemented yet). Manufacture items that can become art pieces in the brokerage gallery. Players will be able to trade and buy your manufactured items and alter them for an in-game price. (Not implemented yet). Complete the narrative. Explore the planet's dungeon and get to floor 100 by keeping your lantern oil up. Keep your lantern oil up by consuming resources and influence global darkness by trading with players without access to special resources (Not implemented yet).</li>
        <li>Other Players: Try to help other people and see what happens</li>
    </ul>
